This script provides a character table. Yes, yet another one :-). 

But it has some nice features:                                      
  - it takes advantage of syntax-highlighting
  - it allows to toggle base of codes without leaving buffer
  - it opens in currently active window, so no rearrangement of windows occur
  - special codes are viewed with their real names (NUL, ETX,...)
  - quitting is very simple and fast - just one keystroke
